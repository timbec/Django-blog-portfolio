<h2>About</h2>

</p>I am a Full-Stack Developer specializing in Javscript, Pythona and PHP. I
have
approximately five years experience in both front and back end development. I started as a developer with the arts and
literature magazine, Sensitive Skin, where I conceptualized and developed the website with the publisher. Since then
I've been freelancing and have been lucky enough to work for clients such as the NYTimes, the Wall Street Journal, Weil,
Gotshal and Manges, Lazard Asset Management, EPIX TV and, most recently, Mullen Lowe Profero.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been working with React.js, Vue.js on the front end and Python Django framework on the back end, though
    have used PHP, Wordpress, and Laravel extensively in the past. I also create in VR/AR using Mozilla’s A-Frame
    through my
    work with the language learning startup CieloXR. I enjoy working in Python and would like to gain more practical
    experience using it, both in web development and its (many) other capacities.</p>

<p>My work with CieloXR has led to an interest in the possibilities for Virtual and Augmented Reality especially in the
    field of EdTech, along with its possibilities in art. I am also starting my own project developing living history
    websites on the Python Django platform. I like working in Python and would like to gain more practical experience
    using
    it, in both web development and its (many) other capacities. I've also become interested in Machine Learning and
    Artificial Intelligence and would, eventually, like to work in those fields, and eventually find a way to combing
    AI/ML
    with VR for better learning experiences.</p>

<p>I am also a writer and have published features, stories, and essays, web content, occasional copy and have excellent
    documentation skills. I will be writing about VR/AR and AI as I gain more experience and knowledge in those fields.
</p>

<p>This site is built on the Python Django Framework. Eventually I might build this out using GraphQL and React (or just
    in
    Gatsby.js, which combines both), but for the moment it is just plain Django. Please be patient while I get this site
    in
    order.</p>
