        <p>
            I am a Front End/Python Developer, with a background in website
            development and, before that, in broadcast media. I have approximately
            five years experience in both front and back end development. I started
            as a developer with the arts and literature magazine, Sensitive Skin,
            where I conceptualized and developed the website with the publisher.
            Since then I've been freelancing and have been lucky enough to work for
            clients such as the NYTimes, the Wall Street Journal, Weil, Gotshal and
            Manges, Lazard Asset Management, EPIX TV and, most recently, Mullen Lowe
            Profero.

        <p>
            Lately, I’ve been working with React.js, Vue.js on the front end and
            Python Django framework on the back end, though have used PHP,
            Wordpress, and Laravel extensively in the past. I also create in VR/AR
            using Mozilla’s A-Frame through my work with the language learning
            startup CieloXR. I enjoy working in Python and would like to gain more
            practical experience using it, both in web development and its (many)
            other capacities.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work with CieloXR has led to an interest in the possibilities for
            Virtual and Augmented Reality especially in the field of EdTech, along
            with its possibilities in art. I am also starting my own project
            developing living history websites on the Python Django platform. I like
            working in Python and would like to gain more practical experience using
            it, in both web development and its (many) other capacities. I've also
            become interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and
            would, eventually, like to work in those fields, and eventually find a
            way to combing AI/ML with VR for better learning experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also a writer and have published features, stories, and essays, web
            content, occasional copy and have excellent documentation skills. I will
            be writing about VR/AR and AI as I gain more experience and knowledge in
            those fields.
        </p>

        <p>
            This site is built on the Python Django Framework. Eventually I might
            build this out using GraphQL and React (or just in Gatsby.js, which
            combines both), but for the moment it is just plain Django. Please be
            patient while I get this site in order.
